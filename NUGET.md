# FScript

FScript is a lightweight, embeddable interpreter with an F#/ML-style language.

## Why

- F#/ML-style scripting with immutable-by-design, expression-oriented semantics.
- Strong static checks with Hindley-Milner type inference.
- Host-controlled extensibility through typed external functions.
- Sandbox-aware runtime model for controlled filesystem and host access.
